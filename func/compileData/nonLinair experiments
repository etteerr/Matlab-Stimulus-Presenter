Events:

if event:
	If case (like input) == something => Skip (or dont skip) the next x trials

event skip x trials
event skip remaining trials (end block)

Possible operations:
	eventIter = eventIter - 1 (repeat this event)
	eventIter = nEvents (stop)
	break (stop NOW)
	return (super stop now!)
	{ (repeater event - Variable repeats)
	
		if event.repeter < event.repeats:
			eventIter = eventIter - 1 - event.nBack
		event.repeater = event.repeater + 1
	} (This steps x events back for y times)


This creates a non linear experiment.
Needed: compileTRialSCriptTemplate_nonLinear.m
This uses whileloops instead of forloops
