function res = gateway(varargin)
%% The first function is the gateway function, this function can be called by the outside world
%   Various commands/events can pass through this funcion
%   Commands beginning with 'do' indicate that you may do something like
%   installing software. For res, you must return true or false indicating
%   if you can still run this function. If its false it will not include
%   your event in the event list.
%   commands beginning with 'get' will need specific output as requested.
% Commands:
%     doInit:         This will be run before the experiment starts
%     getLoadFun:     should return the function to load your data that needs to be displayed. can be a empty string.
%     getRunFun:      should return the function that does something with the loaded data, like displaying it. can be empty string.
%     getQuestStruct: should return a eventEditor compatible struct. if 0, no questions asked. Empty struct will be passed to getEventStruct
%     getEventStruct: given the resulting questStruct (named answerStruct), create a eventStruct you can use.
%     getName:        should return the name of this event.
% notes:
%   the structure containing your data (made in getEventStruct) is always
%   named 'event'. Make sure you use that in getLoadFun and getRunFun.
%
%   The event strucutre contains .eventData  , This variable contains a,
%   from a dataset selected, value. This may be file paths or numbers.
%
%   You may use variables, note that they are only kept within a block.
%
%   Please limit the use of globals, as they may *kugfuckupkug* the timing.
%
%   Before runtime, a script will be made using your strings containing the
%   functions. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Variables you have acces to in runtime.
%   - nEvents (number) => Contains the number of events in this trial (or block)
%   - replyData (struct) => Here you can store your results.
%   - i (number) => The i'th iteration of this block.
